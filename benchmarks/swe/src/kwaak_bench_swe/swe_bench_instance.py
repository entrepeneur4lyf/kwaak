"""SWE-bench instance representation and management.

This module provides the SWEBenchInstance class which represents a single test case
from the SWE-bench dataset. It handles:
- Test case metadata
- Docker container configuration
- Test execution environment setup
- Command generation for test execution

Typical usage:
    instance = SWEBenchInstance(**dataset_item)
    container_name = instance.get_instance_container_name()
    test_cmd = instance.test_cmd
